### 🚀 Projects

#### CAN-Based Body Control Module
- **Role**: Developer
- **Description**: Developed ECUs for wiper control, indicators, and dashboard display using LPC2129 development boards. Implemented CAN protocol for communication between the modules, ensuring real-time updates displayed on an LCD. The project involved designing the system architecture, writing embedded C code for each module, and integrating the modules to function cohesively. Detailed testing was conducted to ensure reliability and real-time performance.

#### Multilevel Security System
- **Role**: Developer
- **Description**: Designed a security system utilizing I2C protocol for EEPROM (AT24C08) interfacing and UART for GSM module communication. Integrated a 4x4 keypad with the LPC2129 board to enter an OTP. Correct OTP entry triggers a motor rotation, while incorrect attempts prompt security alerts. This project involved writing and debugging embedded C code, interfacing with various peripherals, and ensuring secure communication between components.
